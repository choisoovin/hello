Artist Statement<br></p>
<div class="state"><br>
I explore various art mediums that are made from the 19th century to 21st century<br>
 such as Cyanotypes,Van Dyke prints, Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Touch Designer. <br>
 Alternative process photography and digital media arts have two centuries' difference. <br>
 Thus, I like to call myself a time traveler artist because I jump around the centuries to create artworks.<br>
 <br>

    I am Soovin Choi, an international student from South Korea to study arts. Came to the States to study film at first, then I fell in love with film photography while I was studying at Monterey Peninsula College. After I studied black and white photography for 2 years,  I transferred to San Jose State University for a photography program. However, I found my big interest in Digital Media Arts from taking the ART74 class last semester. The infinite possibility of creating unique mix media artwork was the interesting factor of me changing major to Digital Media Arts. Because I have been exploring various art fields, I would like to expand my digital media artwork with my photography and film experiences and techniques.
<br>
<br> 
    From experiencing some photography projects and exhibitions, I have established solid artistic intention in my work. Since I am an international student, who is living life as an alien, I ask myself a lot about my presence, and that anxiety gives me a good motivation for work. I feel more close and creative to my works and projects when it is related to my life. Therefore, most topics I work on are identity, cultures, Korea, stereotypes and discrimination. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I am developing mix media works that are made of various mediums. For example, I made a hand object with wires, then did video projection mapping on it (Video Art-”Welcoming”). My most interest is making interactive art. Still learning audio visualization with Max, but I will learn more, and  would like to make an artwork that the audience can actively interact with. Moreover, since I enjoy the analog and digital platform at the same time, I’d like to explore combining these two elements: analog and digital. 
    <br>
    <br>
Everyday and every moment in the United States for the past four years have inspired, provoked my curiosity and passion and helped seek my voice as an artist. During this journey, creating art is a special shelter where I can breathe. In future, I want to be an art professor who provides a safe shelter to students where they can freely express themselves and find their abilities.
