     Title: Draw your imaginative cloud! <br>
     Year:2021<br>
     Description:<br>
     I often look up at the sky on the bus and enjoy finding the clouds' interesting shapes and abstractly drawing on that cloud.<br>
    Thus, I wanted the user to feel creative, fun, and happy while selecting the random cloud pictures and drawing on them. <br>
    I like to share that fun activity and emotions with many. <br>
 This drawing machine lets the user choose from the random picture of the clouds by clicking the button below; <br>
 and they can freely draw on that chosen cloud by mousepressed function. If they hit ‘s,’ they can save the image too.<br>
  The brush is pastel rainbow to evoke dreamy feeling. <br></div>

     It works better with Firefox due to sound input problem.<br>

        Title: Rabbit Hole (game)<br>
        Year:2021<br>
        Description:<br>
        This is a storybook  that is combined with game: my version of the Alice in Wonderland storybook in a digital world. <br>
        I wanted to create  the fairy tale-like, magical, “Wonderland” art theme for this game to invite the user.<br>
        I set up a concept that only curious users can see and follow White Rabbit to continue  playing the game with five different stages.<br>
        The game makes the user use different functions of the computer(keyboard, mouse, and mic) to continue the rabbit hole of adventure.<br>
        The player does not know which element is the plus or minus to the points, and there is no win nor lose: there is just place of Wonderland or reality.<br>

    Year:2019<br>

    to people by their interest.<br>

    Title: AreaCode 831<br>
    Year:2019<br>
    Description:<br>
  This is a friendly tour guide website for the people who want to travel Monterey County.<br>
Monterey is my first settlement place at States as an international student.<br>
While studying at Monterey Peninsula College, I explored Monterey A LOT.<br>
Thus, I wanted to share this wonderful town with other people.<br>
I put myself as an "editor," and made this Monterey visitor guide book.
It is all created by HTML and CSS. <br></div>

    Title: Soovin Choi (first portfolio website)<br>
    Year:2019<br>
    Description: <br>
    This is my first portfolio website as a photographer.<br>
    Until last semester, I was photography major.<br>
    While making this website, I fell in love the fact how I can involve with technology and art at the same time. <br>
    From making this first porfolio website, I found my art work concept as "time travler," <br>
    because I do art that made in 19 century to 21 century. <br>
It is all made with HTML and CSS. </div>
