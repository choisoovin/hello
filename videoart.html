Title: Welcoming<br>
Year:2020<br>
Medium: Projection mapping video on the shadow box and color wire object<br>
<br>
Description: <Br>
This is a public art project of making a San Jose monument.<br>
I do not want to exclude anyone or feel excluded from my art. I hoped I could invite anyone in public and feel welcomed. <br> Therefore, I made a welcoming hand with colorful wires to invite people. <br> In addition, I filmed San Jose downtown, and did projection mapping on the shadow box for three dimensional effect. <br>
<br>
This year is my first year living in San Jose. <br>
I felt San Jose is open-minded, consisted of various ethnicities, and welcoming. <br>
The city does not welcome individuals and “does not care.” I think that is the most important thing. <br> Even though people do not care or are interested in who I am, strangely I feel "welcoming."<br> There is no awkwardness to being here as a new resident. <br> All different people shows no discrimination, no attention to minorities, but with warm hearts. <br> I want to express this weird warmth feeling from this city with hands, and also want to include everyone.<br>

Title: Daydream<br>
Year:2020<br>
Medium: Premiere Pro, Photoshop<br>
<br>
Description: <Br>
The digital media enable people to mess with the reality. Photoshop, Premiere pro with <br>
 green screen make everything happens. Therefore, I used green screen and “ultra key”<Br>
  effect from Premiere pro to travel around the world that cannot be happened today. <br>
  Inspired by the movie, “Inception.” I try to content the dreams I dream right before the “kick.” <br>
  (In the movie, people need to have a strong physical kick to wake up from dream.) <br>
  All shots created in my tiny room, and footages are the places I wanted to go. <br>
  The places are sometimes abstract and real. While you are dreaming, it feels real but surreal. I wanted to express that mishmash dream. <br>
  <br>

In the video, I travel Korea, Bali, Bahamas, museum and Henri Matisse’s room,<br>
 and I ride a rollercoaster and F1 car at Monaco GP. All I dream about.<br>
 <br>

My flight back to home country for the summer got cancelled this week, <br>
and there are news that Trupm will suspend OPT program soon, which will change my whole education and life plan <br>
(OPT: Optional Practical Training which allows international student to legally work for years after graduation).<br>
 In this chaotic situation, I just wanted to close my eyes for minutes and have a <br>
 daydream. This project was made for me as a breakthrough, and experiment for green <br>
  screen. Later, I want do more creative works and want to make more ridiculous videos with green screen. <br>

Title: Glitch-ish<br>
Year: 2020<br>
Medium: Full HD Color Video, 00"00"55<br>
Description: <br>
It is one minute collage video art.
<br>
 A square format video mixed with my digital art works. <br>
I wanted to practice in controlling the effects panel, so I tried many different effects on Premiere.<br>
Used Ultra key for getting rid of the green part from greenscreen footage, RGB adjustment for vhs effect, and adjusted keyframes. <br>

<br>
Since glitch is such a fun part of digital arts, I cut out some little parts of the video,<br>
so it can look like a glitched video. Used Touch Designer for making distorted videos(pink dolphin and my drawing).<br>
Like I mentioned from previous project that I did, nowadays people's index fingers do everything: web surfing, <br>
send messages, confirm the meeting, etc. I edited index fingers in to human body and earth because of that reason. <br>
"Digital" is everywhere, and humans are everywhere.

Title: Blue Bird<br>
Year: 2020<br>
Medium: Photoshop, Premiere, Max msp, Blippar<br>
Description: In many countries, the blue bird is a symbol of happiness, joy, and enlightenment. <br>
“Bluebirds are always a symbol of something good that is about to come into your life (Dreaming and Sleeping).” <br>
Also, there is a song in Korea, Bluebird by Lee Moon-sae, which is about letting<br> your loved ones go if you love them. Even though you love the bird, the bird would be happier <br>if they could “fly.” My mom said that blue bird reminds her daughter, me, because my mom had to let me go to support my dream. <br>

<br>
However, the blue bird means a lot to me, and in this pandemic time,<br>
 it is the time we need to think about a hopeful subject. <br>
 Therefore, I created a blue bird hanging out on the leaf that has a colorful <br>
 glitch-ish video in it. I used Max2 and Touch designer to make that video.<br>

If you touch the ball shape, it leads to Vimeo. <br>
And when you touch 삐릿삐릿 파랑새(lyrics of the song), it gives you youtube video of <br>Blue bird, song by Lee Moon-sae.<br>

-쉼 means "taking a break."<br>

-삐릿삐릿 파랑새  is my favorite lyric from that Blue bird song.  <br>

Title: Me On The Cutting Board_stopmotion<br>
Year:2020<br>
Medium: Digital Photo transfer on the cutting board and Video(stop motion)<br>
<br>
Description: <Br>
There is a phrase, "you are on the people's cutting board," in Korea, which means you are the target<br>
 from people to talk about, criticize about or pick on. As an international student, as a woman who has an opinion,<br>
and as an artist, most of the time I am the one who is on people's cutting boards.<br>
They are so ready judge me whenever they got bored from their lives.<br>

<br>
Cutting photos of me taken from California, and the action of "cutting" represents how people criticize on me <br>
by my personality, my friendship, my education, my lifestyle, and my success. <br>
To express the remaining stuff(smell or color) from cutting fruit or vegetables on the cutting board,<br>
 I spreaded gel medium on the cutting board, and put a photo print on top, then ripped it off. <br>
 Thus, only ink remains on the cutting board. This method is called digital photo transfer. <br>
 I tried to explore alternative process photography. In addition, I made a stop motion video to add more to the project.

    Title: Video Presentation Flow: Past VS Present <br>
    Year:2020<br>
    Description:<br>
    "...video was initially used as a handy and low-cost tool to document live <br>
    performances that had no mobility or permanence, thereby making these forms <br>transportable and more accessible to audiences beyond the original site of <br>presentation." (Busting the Tube: A Brief History of Video Art)  <br>
    In 2020, if the video is boring, people start to look up different video immediately, <br>
    unlike 1960s or 1970s. Wanted to show how we differently see the video art, and <br>
    how we differently present to the audience in different flow depending on the <br>
    period(ex. one-take shot vs fast transition).<br>
